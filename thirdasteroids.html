    <p>Asteroids, meteoroids, and comets are small celestial bodies that, despite their size, play vital roles in understanding the history and structure of our Solar System. Asteroids are rocky, metallic objects primarily located in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter. They range widely in size—from tiny pebbles to dwarf planet-like bodies such as Ceres and Vesta—and are thought to be remnants from the early Solar System that never coalesced into a planet due to Jupiter’s gravitational influence. Their surfaces are often cratered and irregular, offering clues about ancient collisions and the chaotic early days of planet formation.<br>
        <br>
Meteoroids are much smaller fragments of rock or metal, usually originating from broken asteroids or disintegrating comets. When a meteoroid enters Earth’s atmosphere, it burns due to friction, creating a bright streak of light known as a meteor, or more commonly, a "shooting star." If part of it survives the fiery descent and lands on Earth, it is then classified as a meteorite. These meteorites are invaluable to scientists because they provide a direct sample of Solar System material, often dating back billions of years.<br>
<br>
Comets, in contrast, are icy bodies that originate from the distant Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, vast regions beyond Neptune. Comets are composed of rock, dust, and frozen gases like water, carbon dioxide, and methane. As a comet approaches the Sun, the heat causes its ice to sublimate, forming a glowing coma (a halo of gas and dust) and a tail that always points away from the Sun due to solar wind. Famous comets like Halley’s Comet or Comet NEOWISE have captivated human imagination for centuries, often appearing as spectacular sky events visible to the naked eye.<br>
<br>
Together, these bodies are considered “leftovers” from the Solar System’s formation, and studying them provides insight into the raw materials that formed the planets and moons. Additionally, some scientists believe that comets may have delivered water and organic molecules to the early Earth, possibly contributing to the origin of life. Their unpredictable orbits and potential to collide with Earth have also made them important subjects for planetary defense and space exploration efforts.
