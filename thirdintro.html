        <p>The Solar System is an immense and intricate cosmic neighborhood, with the Sun at its heart, acting as a
            powerful gravitational anchor that holds everything in place. Formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago
            from a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust, our Solar System emerged when this cloud collapsed under its
            own gravity, possibly triggered by a nearby supernova. The collapse led to the formation of a rotating disk
            known as the solar nebula, with the Sun forming at its center and the remaining material gradually
            coalescing into planets, moons, and other celestial bodies. Today, the Solar System is made up of eight
            officially recognized planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—each of
            which follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun. These planets are broadly classified into two types: the
            rocky terrestrial planets (Mercury through Mars) and the gas/ice giants (Jupiter through Neptune), each
            possessing unique atmospheric conditions, surface features, and internal structures.<br>
            <br>

            Beyond the major planets, the Solar System is also home to a wide variety of other bodies. Dwarf planets
            such as Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres share similarities with planets but do not dominate their
            orbital zones. Moons, or natural satellites, orbit most of the planets—some, like Jupiter’s Ganymede and
            Saturn’s Titan, are even larger than Mercury. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter contains thousands
            of rocky bodies, remnants from the early Solar System that never formed into a planet due to Jupiter’s
            immense gravitational pull. Even smaller are meteoroids, which are fragments of asteroids or comets; when
            they enter Earth’s atmosphere and burn up, they create meteors or “shooting stars,” and if they survive the
            descent, they are called meteorites. Meanwhile, comets—icy bodies originating mostly from the Kuiper Belt
            and the distant Oort Cloud—develop glowing comas and tails when they approach the Sun due to the sublimation
            of their icy components.<br>
            <br>
            The structure of the Solar System extends far beyond the orbit of Neptune. The Kuiper Belt is a region of
            icy bodies and dwarf planets, and farther still lies the hypothetical Oort Cloud, a spherical shell of
            frozen objects thought to surround the Solar System at vast distances. The arrangement of the Solar System
            reflects a delicate balance of gravitational forces, orbital dynamics, and cosmic history. The Sun,
            accounting for more than 99.8% of the Solar System's mass, is the central engine driving everything—from
            climate systems on planets to the orbits of distant icy comets. The planets and other bodies orbit in the
            same general plane, known as the ecliptic, and mostly rotate and revolve in the same direction, evidence of
            their common origin in the solar nebula.<br>
            <br>
            Space exploration has played a vital role in unveiling the secrets of this grand system. Since the mid-20th
            century, space agencies like NASA (USA), ESA (Europe), Roscosmos (Russia), CNSA (China), and ISRO (India)
            have sent numerous probes and missions to explore the planets and other bodies. NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2
            missions have now entered interstellar space, while rovers like Perseverance on Mars continue to look for
            signs of ancient life. ISRO’s Mangalyaan demonstrated India’s capability in planetary exploration, and
            telescopes like Hubble and the James Webb Space Telescope offer new perspectives on our place in the
            universe.<br>
            <br>
            Each component of the Solar System contributes to its rich diversity and complexity. Whether it's Earth’s
            life-supporting atmosphere, Jupiter’s massive magnetic field, Saturn’s iconic rings, or the mysterious icy
            bodies at its edges, the Solar System continues to captivate astronomers, scientists, and curious minds
            around the globe. It is not just a group of orbiting objects—it is a cosmic storybook, each chapter telling
            us about our past, present, and perhaps even our future among the stars.<br>
