    <p>The history of the Solar System is a remarkable tale that stretches back approximately 4.6 billion years to the collapse of a vast and ancient molecular cloud composed primarily of gas and dust. Scientists believe this collapse may have been triggered by the shockwave from a nearby supernova explosion, which disturbed the delicate balance of pressure and gravity within the cloud. As the cloud began to contract under its own gravitational pull, it started spinning and flattened into a rotating disk known as the solar nebula. At the center of this disk, most of the material gathered to form a protostar, which eventually ignited nuclear fusion and became our Sun. The remaining dust, rock, and gas particles orbiting the young Sun gradually began to stick together through electrostatic forces and later gravitational attraction, forming small solid bodies called planetesimals.<br>
        <br>
These planetesimals collided and merged over millions of years to form protoplanets—larger bodies that would eventually become the planets and moons we recognize today. The intense heat near the young Sun meant that only metals and rocky materials could solidify close to the center, which led to the formation of the terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—in the inner Solar System. Farther out, beyond the "frost line," temperatures were low enough for volatile compounds like water, methane, and ammonia to freeze, allowing gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, and ice giants like Uranus and Neptune, to form. These outer planets grew rapidly by accreting both solid material and large amounts of gas from the solar nebula before it was blown away by the solar wind.<br>
<br>
During the early stages of planetary formation, the Solar System was chaotic and violent. A period known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, which occurred around 3.9 billion years ago, saw a spike in asteroid and comet impacts across the inner planets, leaving craters that are still visible on the Moon and other rocky bodies today. These impacts likely played a crucial role in delivering water and organic compounds to Earth, which may have helped set the stage for life. Additionally, the giant planets did not initially form in their current positions—gravitational interactions and migrations of Jupiter and Saturn, in particular, caused significant shifts in the Solar System’s architecture. These movements influenced the orbits of other planets and scattered smaller bodies like asteroids and comets into new regions, forming belts like the asteroid belt and the distant Kuiper Belt.<br>
<br>
As the eons passed, the Solar System gradually settled into a more stable configuration. The Sun reached a steady state of nuclear fusion, providing light and heat, and the planets established relatively circular orbits within the flattened plane of the solar disk. However, evolution did not stop there. Even now, our Solar System continues to change, albeit at a slower pace. Collisions still occur, as evidenced by occasional meteor strikes on Earth. Gravitational influences continue to shape orbital paths, and new discoveries in regions like the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud are reshaping our understanding of the Solar System's extent and origin. Moreover, space missions—like NASA’s Voyager probes, which have entered interstellar space, and the James Webb Space Telescope—are giving us deeper insight into how solar systems form and evolve elsewhere in the galaxy. In essence, the history of our Solar System is not a closed chapter but an ongoing saga that reveals both our origins and our place in the vast cosmos.
