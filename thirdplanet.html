    <p>The planets of the Solar System are the most prominent and massive celestial bodies that revolve around the Sun, each showcasing an incredible diversity in composition, structure, and behavior. There are eight officially recognized planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—each following elliptical orbits around the Sun due to its immense gravitational pull. These planets are traditionally grouped into two major categories based on their physical and chemical characteristics: the terrestrial (rocky) planets and the gas and ice giants. The terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars— are located in the inner Solar System and are composed mainly of silicate rocks and metals. These planets have solid surfaces, relatively smaller sizes, higher densities, and fewer or no moons. Earth, the third planet, is the only known planet to support life, with liquid water, a protective atmosphere, and a magnetic field. Mars, often called the "Red Planet" due to iron oxide on its surface, continues to captivate scientists with signs of ancient water flow and the potential for past microbial life.<br>

Beyond the asteroid belt lie the gas and ice giants—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These outer planets are significantly larger than the terrestrial ones and are composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and various ices like ammonia and methane. Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, has more than 90 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot, a giant storm, has been raging for centuries. Saturn, second in size, is famous for its breathtaking ring system made up of ice and rock particles. Uranus is unique for its extreme axial tilt—it essentially rolls along its orbit—and has a pale blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. Neptune, the most distant of the eight, is known for its intense winds and dark storms, some even faster than the speed of sound. Despite its distance from the Sun, Neptune exhibits surprising weather activity and has at least 14 moons, the largest being Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction of the planet’s rotation—a clue to its possible capture from the Kuiper Belt.<br>
<br>
Each planet is a world of its own, featuring unique atmospheric conditions, magnetic fields, geological formations, and weather systems. Some, like Venus, have thick, toxic atmospheres that trap heat through runaway greenhouse effects, while others, like Mercury, have almost no atmosphere at all and experience extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night. The orbital periods of the planets vary greatly—Mercury completes a revolution around the Sun in just 88 Earth days, while Neptune takes about 165 Earth years. Their rotational periods (lengths of days) also differ; for example, a day on Jupiter is just about 10 hours, the shortest of any planet, while Venus rotates so slowly and in the opposite direction that a day is longer than its year.<br>
<br>
The study of these planets—known as planetary science—has been central to our understanding of how solar systems form and evolve. By examining their atmospheres, surfaces, and internal structures, scientists gain insights not only into Earth’s past and future but also into the conditions that might support life elsewhere. Robotic missions, such as NASA’s Voyager, Cassini, Juno, and Perseverance, have significantly expanded our knowledge, revealing the complex beauty and mystery of these distant worlds. As we continue to explore our planetary neighbors, each discovery opens a window into the broader workings of the cosmos, sparking curiosity and guiding the search for habitable planets beyond our Solar System.
