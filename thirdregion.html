        The Solar System is an intricately structured collection of regions, each with distinct physical characteristics and types of celestial bodies. At its core is the inner Solar System, which houses the four terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—characterized by their rocky compositions, relatively small sizes, and proximity to the Sun. This region is also where the majority of solar energy is concentrated, influencing the development and behavior of these planets. Just beyond Mars lies the Asteroid Belt, a vast ring of rocky debris and small planetary remnants that forms a natural boundary between the inner and outer Solar System. It is home to countless irregularly shaped asteroids and some larger bodies like Ceres, a dwarf planet that provides clues to planetary formation.<br>
        <br>
Moving outward, we enter the outer Solar System, a zone dominated by the massive gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). These planets are significantly larger than their inner counterparts and are surrounded by complex systems of rings and moons. Their immense gravitational pull has played a major role in shaping the architecture of the Solar System, including the capture and deflection of comets and asteroids.<br>
<br>
Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped region populated by icy bodies and dwarf planets such as Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. The Kuiper Belt is believed to be a remnant of the early Solar System, containing primordial material left over from the solar nebula. It serves as a transitional zone between the planetary domain and the farthest reaches of the Sun’s influence.<br>
<br>
Even farther out is the hypothetical Oort Cloud, a vast, spherical shell of icy objects that may extend up to 100,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. Although it has not yet been directly observed, the Oort Cloud is theorized to be the source of long-period comets—those with orbits lasting thousands of years. It marks the outermost boundary of the Sun’s gravitational influence and represents the Solar System’s final frontier before interstellar space.<br>
<br>
These distinct regions—inner planets, asteroid belt, outer planets, Kuiper Belt, and Oort Cloud—help astronomers organize our cosmic neighborhood and understand how planetary systems evolve. Each zone holds critical pieces of the Solar System's history, from the violent collisions of early planet formation to the quiet, icy orbits of objects at the edge of the Sun's reach.
