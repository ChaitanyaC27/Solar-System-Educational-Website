    <p>Since the mid-20th century, humanity’s quest to explore the Solar System has accelerated dramatically through the pioneering efforts of space agencies like NASA (USA), ESA (European Space Agency), ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation), Roscosmos (Russia), and CNSA (China National Space Administration). These organizations have launched a wide array of spacecraft, orbiters, landers, and rovers that have journeyed across the Solar System, capturing astonishing images and returning invaluable scientific data. These missions have expanded our knowledge of planetary formation, geology, atmospheric processes, magnetic fields, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.<br>
        <br>
One of the earliest milestones in space exploration was the Apollo Moon landings by NASA, beginning with Apollo 11 in 1969, when humans first set foot on the Moon. In the decades since, missions like NASA’s Viking landers, Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and the advanced Perseverance rover have investigated the surface of Mars, uncovering evidence of ancient rivers, lakes, and organic molecules, and even testing technologies for future human missions. The ESA’s Rosetta mission successfully orbited and deployed a lander (Philae) on Comet 67P, providing the first up-close look at a comet’s surface.<br>
<br>
NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2, launched in 1977, have traveled beyond the planets, with Voyager 1 now officially in interstellar space, still transmitting data back to Earth more than four decades later. The New Horizons mission conducted a historic flyby of Pluto in 2015, revealing a surprisingly complex world with ice mountains and possible cryovolcanoes. Missions like Juno, currently orbiting Jupiter, are probing its intense magnetic field and deep atmosphere, while Cassini gave us a long-term view of Saturn and its moons, particularly Titan and Enceladus, which may harbor subsurface oceans and the conditions for life.<br>
<br>
Other nations have also made significant contributions. ISRO’s Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) made India the first Asian country to reach Mars orbit, and on its first attempt. China’s Chang’e missions have not only orbited but also landed on and returned samples from the Moon, with future plans aiming for Mars and beyond. Meanwhile, ESA’s JUICE mission and NASA’s Europa Clipper, scheduled for upcoming launches, will further investigate the icy moons of Jupiter—potential hotspots for alien life.<br>
<br>
Altogether, these exploration efforts have reshaped our understanding of the Solar System’s origin, dynamic evolution, and potential habitability, transforming distant, mysterious celestial bodies into familiar landscapes rich in scientific intrigue. With each new mission, we come closer to answering humanity’s oldest questions: Are we alone in the universe? How did life begin? And what is our place in the cosmos?</p>
