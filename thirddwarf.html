    <p>Dwarf planets are a fascinating class of celestial bodies that share many features with the eight major planets but differ in one key way—they have not cleared their orbital neighborhoods of other debris. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU) definition adopted in 2006, a dwarf planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is massive enough for its gravity to shape it into a nearly round (spherical) form, but has not become gravitationally dominant in its region of space. This redefinition led to the controversial reclassification of Pluto, once the ninth planet, into a dwarf planet, sparking widespread debate and interest both within and outside the scientific community. Pluto, though no longer classified as a full-fledged planet, remains the most well-known dwarf planet, primarily because of its historical significance and rich, complex system, including five moons—the largest of which, Charon, is so massive relative to Pluto that the two are sometimes considered a double dwarf planet system.<br>
        <br>
There are five officially recognized dwarf planets in our Solar System: Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres, though astronomers suspect there may be hundreds or even thousands more, particularly in the distant regions beyond Neptune. These dwarf planets are spread across various parts of the Solar System. Ceres is the only one located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It was the first dwarf planet discovered (in 1801) and was once considered a planet in the early 19th century. Unlike its icy cousins, Ceres is made primarily of rock and water ice and has shown evidence of possible subsurface briny liquid and water vapor—making it a target of interest in the search for signs of life. The remaining dwarf planets—Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake—reside in the Kuiper Belt, a cold, distant region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies and debris left over from the Solar System’s formation.<br>
<br>
Each dwarf planet possesses unique characteristics. Eris, discovered in 2005, is slightly smaller than Pluto but more massive, and its discovery was one of the key factors that led to Pluto’s reclassification. Eris has one known moon, Dysnomia, and is located in the scattered disc region of the Kuiper Belt, far from the Sun. Haumea, recognized for its elongated, football-like shape due to its rapid rotation, also has two moons and features a ring system—one of the few known outside the giant planets. Makemake, another distant icy world, is known for its reddish color and very low temperatures, often hovering near -240°C. While no atmosphere has been directly detected on Makemake, seasonal changes suggest a thin, transient atmosphere may form as it approaches the Sun.<br>

The study of dwarf planets provides critical insights into the early history and structure of the Solar System. These bodies are believed to be remnants from the Solar System’s formation over 4.5 billion years ago, preserving ancient materials and conditions. They act as cosmic time capsules, helping scientists understand the processes that shaped the planets and the distribution of ice, rock, and organic compounds in the outer regions. Missions such as NASA’s Dawn, which orbited Ceres, and New Horizons, which flew by Pluto in 2015, have revolutionized our understanding of these remote worlds, revealing active geology, potential subsurface oceans, and atmospheric phenomena. As technology advances, future missions to the Kuiper Belt and beyond are likely to uncover even more dwarf planets, reshaping our view of what constitutes a planet and expanding our knowledge of the dynamic, diverse nature of our Solar System.</p>
